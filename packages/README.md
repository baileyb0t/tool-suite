# Play with the toys you have before you get new ones

I'm often tempted to download a package (especially for Python) after reading something about it, but then I don't make time to use it and quickly forget.

So, I decided to set aside some time on Saturday mornings and go through my environment to chip away at all these dusty, unimported packages I've abandoned by exploring them in an interactive session.

Cheers!
